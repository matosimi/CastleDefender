Castle Defender is a tower defense game originally written for BBC Micro. 

I got in contact with the original author and used his sources to port the game to Atari XL/XE computers. 

You can read the conversion story [HERE](http://matosimi.websupport.sk/atari/2019/08/the-story-of-castle-defender/).

Castle Defender took 2nd place at ABBUC SWC 2019 and 3rd place at Kaz Compo 2019.

Current version is v1.4 from 2025.
